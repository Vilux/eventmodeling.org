<p><img src="history.jpg" alt="history of event modeling"></p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Event Modeling&rdquo; was established after the Event Storming Summit in July 2018 in Bologna Italy. It was apparent then that the specific approaches differed significantly. While Event Storming focuses in discovering the problem space, Event Modeling creates a blueprint for a solution. Because Event Modeling doesn&rsquo;t take a long time, it can also act as a problem space exploration exercise by trying multiple solutions.</p>
