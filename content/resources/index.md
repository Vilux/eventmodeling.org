## [Slack Group](#slack-group) {#slack-group}

The community needed a non-technical discussion on Information System design. The Slack channel was created to create an environment where this type of discussion could happen and allow a new avenue for the practice to get adopted. You can join the community throught this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/eventmodeling/shared_invite/enQtNzE0NjAyMjMwNjQ2LTY1NjgzZWI4ZjE0NmM0MWU0OGQwNjA3ZTZkZWViYWUzMTRjZWViYzdhZWMzNWMwZjQyM2VhMWVjZWQ5NjNjMjU)
